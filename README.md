Open world strategy jrpg. for now its a poc
This is coded in C
i mostly just really really really didn't want to use unity, so i decided to use c. which is a language i never used before 2 days ago (6-2-2021)
though i have used python and java fairly extensively. c doesn't seem to be that hard lol.
